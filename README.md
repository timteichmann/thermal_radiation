# Thermal radiation simulation
Simulation of thermal radiation in vacuum using Monte Carlo via SPARTA DSMC suite.

As an example / validation the case from reference 10.1016/j.fusengdes.2012.01.036 is simulated with excellent agreement with the reference regarding the heat flows to the different surfaces.
